1. Input File:

Create a text file named message.txt and write the message you want to encrypt or decrypt in it.

2. Running the Program:

If message.txt contains "cyber security", the program will read the file, ask for the shift value, and either encrypt or decrypt the message based on the user's choice.
The result is saved to encrypted_message.txt or decrypted_message.txt.
Output:

For encryption with a shift value of 3, encrypted_message.txt will contain "fbehu vhfxulwb".
For decryption, the result will be "cyber security".

Create a message.txt file containing the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Run the script.

Provide the filename (message.txt), shift value, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt.
